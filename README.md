The learning-spring-http repository contains files with projects created to practise my skills related to RestControllers, Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, Thymeleaf template engine and Bootstrap framework.

The basic view enables to edit or delete a profile after the prior confirmation. The project has the options of listing all the profiles, displaying their details and also veryfying their incorrect entries. 
- [ToDo]( https://github.com/katarzynaNow/learning-spring-http/tree/master/src/main/java/com/example/springhttp/toDo), [todos-html]( https://github.com/katarzynaNow/learning-spring-http/tree/master/src/main/resources/templates/todos) – an application allowing to create and list all the information about tasks. The application enables to change the tasks’ status using buttons triggering also the status font color change.
